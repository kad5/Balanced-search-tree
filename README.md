this is a practice project for a balanced binary search tree. the main function is a class function that takes an unordered array, removes duplicates then runs mergeSort on it via helper functions. from the array a balanced binary search tree is constructed with the following methods, insert (to add, can call for balancing on its own) , delete (works for any node in the tree and takes care of the tree structre, can call for balancing), rebalance, isBalanced, level order traversal, in, pre, post order traversal, find, height, depth, and lastely a helper function to generate test data. this project allowed me more practice with recursion which im now more confortable coding.
