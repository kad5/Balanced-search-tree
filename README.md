this is a practice project for a balanced binary search tree. the main function is a class function that takes an unordered array, removes duplicates then runs mergeSort on it via helper functions. from the array a balanced binary search tree is constructed with the following methods, insert (to add, can call for balancing on its own) , delete (works for any node in the tree and takes care of the tree structre, can call for balancing), rebalance, isBalanced, level order traversal, in, pre, post order traversal, find, height, depth, and lastely a helper function to generate test data. this project allowed me more practice with recursion which im now getting a little bit more confortable coding. on review of other students' codes i realize i should have used recursion more particularly with the insert and delete functions. it minimizes the code significantly. The difficulty i have with it is returning correctly. This was a big issue prior to the recursion lesson, and now since being forced to deal with the issue correctly, i am getting more comfortable with return. 

an optimization would be to the isBalanced method, currently it checks height and calls itself this is n^2. it would be better to merge the two in one function, or rewrite the height func logic insde isBalanced. but this structure is what the course instructor asked for.
